# Diabetic Prediction & Accuracy Checker
The purpose of this tool is to help predict the chances of a patient having diabetes.
This is not a diagnostic tool. This tool allows you to enter a variety of factors related to your health in order to help you narrow the potential of becoming diabetic and take the appriopriate measures.
The most reliable way to determine the cause and the treatment of your findings is to visit your doctor. Thank you for using DPAC
